This script can be invoked like:

rm -rf /etc/ansible/ansible-pan/ansible-pan/ansible-playbooks/ansible-pull
watch -n 5 "ansible-pull -o -d /etc/ansible/ansible-pan/ansible-pan/ansible-playbooks/ansible-pull -U https://github.com/johnkozina/ansible-pull.git"

Update the script with your own configuration and make sure that your own
repository is specified. The only file needed for the default configuration is
file named 'local.yml'.
